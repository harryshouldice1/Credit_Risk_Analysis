# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose
Use ensemble and resampling techniques.  Figure out whihch supervised learning algorithm is best depending on the situation.

## Naive Random Oversampling
The precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .66/.67

## SMOTE Oversampling
The precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .62/.64

## Undersampling
The precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .63/.40

## Combination Under-Over Sampling
The precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .70/.57

## Balanced Random FOrest Classifier
Precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .67/.91

## Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
The precision is low for high risk and high for low risk loans.  High/Low risk = .91/.94
